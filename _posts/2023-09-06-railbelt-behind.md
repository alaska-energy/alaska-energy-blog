The cost of utility-scale [solar has dropped 76% since 2010](https://emp.lbl.gov/sites/default/files/utility_scale_solar_2022_edition_slides.pdf){:target="_blank"} and [wind
costs have dropped 45%](https://emp.lbl.gov/sites/default/files/2023_lbwmr_final.pdf){:target="_blank"}. The improved cost-effectiveness of these technologies
has spurred a rapid increase in the electricity generated from these technologies in
the US.  But, how have we done in the Alaskan Railbelt as far as adoption of
wind and solar?

The graph below shows the percent of utility-scale electric energy generated
from solar and wind both [for the US](https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/browser/#/topic/0?agg=0,1&fuel=vtvo&geo=vvvvvvvvvvvvo&linechart=ELEC.GEN.ALL-US-99.A&columnchart=ELEC.GEN.ALL-US-99.A&map=ELEC.GEN.ALL-US-99.A&freq=A&ctype=linechart&ltype=pin&rtype=s&pin=&rse=0&maptype=0){:target="_blank"} as a whole and for the Railbelt.

The rapid rise in solar and wind adoption in the Lower-49 is readily apparent
in the graph.  For the US, 14% of total utility-scale electricity production
came from solar and wind in 2022.  However, the story in the Railbelt is substantially less
dramatic.  In 2022, 2.2% of electricity generation in the Railbelt came from
solar and wind, about six times less than the US.

The vast majority of the Railbelt wind/solar generation is contributed by the Eva Creek 25 MW wind
plant and the 18 MW Fire Island wind plant, both of which began production near 2013.  The
Eva Creek plant has suffered capacity factor declines in recent years, explaining the gradual
decrease in the Railbelt wind/solar fraction.

Although wind/solar production is far behind lower-48 levels, a number of Railbelt
projects are currently under consideration.  The graph below looks into the near future
to see how wind and solar deployment might progress in both the Railbelt and the US.

Starting with the US figures, the [EIA projects wind/solar fractions](https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/steo/report/BTL/2023/02-genmix/article.php){:target="_blank"} of 16% and 18% for
2023 and 2024 respectively. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory estimates
that fraction will [increase to 40 - 62% by 2030](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy23osti/85242.pdf){:target="_blank"}. (The graph above targets 47%
for 2030).  

As for the Railbelt line on the graph, the projection assumes that most *all* of the
currently contemplated projects will be built on a fairly aggressive time frame.  Included
are the Chugach Electric 120 MW Little Mount Susitna Wind project and the 120 MW Great Lands
Solar project, as described in the [Black & Veatch Chugach Gas Supply Option and 
Market Assessment](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TExipvMixwMAuBWqIHUhedfNNGLWGsKf/view){:target="_blank"}.
Also included is the Golden Valley Electric Shovel Creek Wind project, assumed here to be
built at the 60 MW capacity level.  Matanuska Electric's recently completed 6 MW Houston
Solar project is included, as well as a 30 MW solar project being considered by Homer
Electric.  All of these Railbelt wind/solar projects are being proposed by Independent
Power Producers, hoping to sell power from projects to the above-mentioned utilities or
sell the projects outright to the utilities.

Completion of these projects would be a very large step forward for wind and solar
deployment in the Railbelt.  *However, the graph shows that the fraction of electricity
generated from wind and solar in the Railbelt will still almost certainly lag behind
US levels.*

Stay tuned for future posts on the economic benefits and costs of these wind and solar projects.

Finally, the table below shows the energy contributions of each of the Railbelt projects
discussed above.
